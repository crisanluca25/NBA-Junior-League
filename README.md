# NBA Junior League 🏀 (C#)

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-yellow)

Welcome to the NBA Junior League, a championship management system designed for school teams across Romania! This project combines 420 players, 28 teams, and a user-friendly interface to explore games, scores, and player details—all built with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP).

# Key Features ✨
- 📋 Team Players
  - View the full roster of players for any team in the league.
- 🏃‍♂️ Active Players in a Game
  - Identify starters and substitutes for a team during a game.
- 📅 Game Schedule
  - Filter and view games happening within a specific date range.
- ⛹️ Game Scores
  - Check the scores of completed games at a glance.
 
# Data Highlights 🗂️
- 420 Players: Each one represents their respective school.
- 28 Teams: Every team is linked to a school in the database.

# Technologies Used 🛠️
- C#: The application is built entirely in C# with a fully OOP architecture for clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
- PostgreSQL: A robust and efficient database for managing teams, players, and games.

# Why is this Project Special? 🌟
This project is more than a database application—it’s a fully object-oriented solution, incorporating:

- Encapsulation: Protecting data and maintaining clean interactions.
- Inheritance: Reusing logic to simplify the codebase.
- Polymorphism: Implementing dynamic behaviors for various entities.
- Abstraction: Streamlining complex logic into manageable components.

By combining clean code principles with practical functionality, this project offers a thoughtful and well-structured solution.
